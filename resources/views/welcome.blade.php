            Chinook Wawa is a hybrid language consisting of simplified Chinookan, combined with contributions from
            Nuuchahnulth (Nootkan), Canadian French, English, and other languages. It originated on the lower Columbia
            River, where it once was the predominant medium of intertribal and interethnic communication.
            Even after English came into general use on the lower Columbia, Chinuk Wawa survived for generations in
            families and communities shaped by the meeting of the regionâ€™s historically diverse tribes and races.
